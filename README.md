An experiment in writing custom firmware for the Cosmo Communicator's cover display. Very dysfunctional.

Requires https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeL4

### A Vague Todo List

- Figure out how to get the linker script to map the framebuffer at the start of SRAM
- Figure out why I can't initialise the NOR flash properly
- Do more, like, /useful/ things
- Make the code less awful
